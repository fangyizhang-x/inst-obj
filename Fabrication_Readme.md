# Fabrication Readme

A prototype instrumented object is shown in Fig. 3 in the paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14466). 

- The first fabrication step of this prototype involves assembling the internal sensor core (Fig. 3a). This core consists of a rigid cube, 3D printed from PETG filament, which offers good layer adhesion and durability. The cube has a hollow centre designed for wiring purposes. On each face of the cube, three TMAG5273 Hall sensors are securely glued into recesses. These sensors are evenly spaced around the middle of the face, where the connected signal and power wires are routed into the centre of the cube.

- Each of the sensors is secured on a small custom PCB with a power decoupling capacitor, and is connected to the Arduino microcontrollerâ€™s SDA, SCL and GND pins via thin 0.25mm enamel copper wires. For prototyping, the Arduino was mounted outside of the prototype due to space and wiring constraints, which prevented the use of one of the six faces of the prototype -- 21 wires are required in total for connecting the sensors on the other five faces to the microcontroller and one face is used for passing these wires. In a complete implementation, an internal wireless microcontroller can be used together with a battery to eliminate the dependency on external wires.

- The silicone shell (Fig. 3b) was moulded using a 2-part, 3D-printed mould. The outer mould was a large cube with 6mm diameter extrusions at each magnet location, while the inner mould was a cube of the same size as the internal sensor core. Platsil GEL-10 Prosthetic Grade Silicone was used in this paper to create the silicone shell with a desirable hardness of Shore A10. Different properties of the instrumented objects can be achieved by using different materials such as silicone with different levels of hardness. Once cured, the mould was separated, and the silicone shell was peeled out. The internal core was then pushed into the shell to add rigidity.

- To complete the assembly, the magnets were inserted into each of their moulded holes on the outside of the shell with the north poles facing outward. A thin layer of additional silicone was then applied to the surface, sealing the magnets in place as in Fig. 3b.

## CAD_Models:
- The file Internal_3_hall_mould contains the two part mould required to create the silicone shell of the sensor. These two parts clip together and mixed 2-part/platinum cure silicone can be poured in. It is recommended to place the filled mould in a vacuum chamber to remove bubbles from within the silicone during the curing process. 

-  The file Internal_multi_sensor_core is the core which is inserted into the shell. The supplied pcb design fits into the surface of the core and attached wires are routed into the center of each face and through the core.

- The files Probe_x contain the probes used during data collection for the paper. These were mounted onto a vernier dual force sensor during initial calibration and onto a Franka Emika Gripper for Panda for data collection.

- The file TMAG5273A1_PCB_mini is a cad model of the PCB and attached TMAG5273A1 hall effect sensor and capacitor. 

## PCB:
The supplied pcb can be opened using kicad for editing. This pcb holds a single TMAG5273A1 sensor and capacitor. Wires are inserted into the through holes and soldered. Reommend gluing the fibers to the pcb for strain relief. The folder GBR_Files contains the files required for printing via PCBway.

## Images:
Various images from the paper and some extas are supplied to demonstrate the assembly and testing setups used.

## Arduino Code:
The code provided was used in multiple experiments, it is set up to program and read data from a 3 sensor prototype, and a 15 sensor prototype. It runs on an arduino mega and can be connected to a cnc machine that accepts grbl to control the probes if required. Data from the sensors is printed over serial and putty was used to save the large amounts of incoming data.


## Notes:
If further information is required please contact fangyi.zhang@qut.edu.au and a more detailed guideline can be created.

The current design can be improved upon by switching to a sensor that remembers programmed i2c addresses. The TMAG5273A1 only has 4 factory addresses and new addresses must be assigned on startup to use multiple simultaneously. This required an additional power wire to power on each sensor individually during startup for programming. Using a sensor that recalls its programmed address on boot will simplify the wiring significantly. Other methods could be the use of multiplexers or alternative communication protocols. If the number of required GPIO is reduced an internal microcontroller with wireless capability can be used such as an esp32s3.
